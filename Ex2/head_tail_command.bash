I want to apologize to all the women I have called beautiful
before I've called them intelligent or brave.
I am sorry I made it sound as though
something as simple as what you're born with
is all you have to be proud of
when you have broken mountains with your wit.
From now on, I will say things like
you are resilient, or you are extraordinary
not because I don't think you're beautiful
but because I'need you to know
you are more than that.

And the people stayed home.
And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. 
And listened more deeply.
Some meditated, some prayed, some danced.
Some met their shadows.
And the people began to think differently. And the people healed.
And, in the absence of people living in ignorant, dangerous, mindless, and heartless ways, the earth began to heal.
And when the danger passed, and the people joined together again, they grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images, and created new ways to live and heal the earth fully, as they had been healed.
